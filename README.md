# Social Network API
Description
This project is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The API is built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. This application demonstrates the use of NoSQL databases in managing large amounts of unstructured data, as commonly required in social network platforms.
